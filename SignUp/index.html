<h2 id="who-may-apply-for-a-deter-project-or-request-a-user-account:be6bb6cac7b36defc6fd573e81b159b3">Who may apply for a DETER project or request a user account?</h2>

<p>Researchers from academia, government, and industry &ndash; as well as educators from academic institutions &ndash; may apply for a DeterLab project account. A student must have their professor or appropriate faculty member apply for an account, and once it is activated the student can then apply for membership to that project.</p>

<p><small> For more information on using DeterLab for education, please refer to the  <a href="https://education.deterlab.net" target="_blank">DeterLab Education Site</a>. </small></p>

<h2 id="to-register:be6bb6cac7b36defc6fd573e81b159b3">To Register</h2>

<p>DETER accounts are grouped by projects, therefore the project leader or PI must first request a project, then other users apply for membership to that project.</p>

<p><small> If you already have a DeterLab account, please login in first. This will help streamline the process. </small></p>
